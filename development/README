This setup uses ot3 for web2py apps, ot9 for treemachine and taxomachine, and
ot10 for the Open Tree API and oti. This should use the final development domain names:
    devtree.opentreeoflife.org
    devapi.opentreeoflife.org

NOTE that the API and oti are using a dummy docstore (phylesystem-0), so we can build and test
the API without polluting the real docstore repo!
